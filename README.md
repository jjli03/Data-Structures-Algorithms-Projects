Project1:
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Joshua Li, li002380\
To compile, use a standard terminal and locate where the FractalDrawer class is. Compile with javac FractalDrawer.java and run with java FractalDrawer.\
Assumptions are that the user types in one of the three shapes correctly in all lowercase letters. If this is not the case, the program will print out \'93invalid shape\'94 along with an empty canvas. Total Area will remain at zero.\
Bugs/Defects: Error when projecting the fractal onto the canvas. Sometimes the complete fractal does not appear fully on the canvas. This problem is usually fixed by pulling out the canvas window and expanding it.\

To compile, use a standard terminal and locate where the Game class is. Compile with javac Game.java Board.java Boat.java Cell.java and run with java Game. Game contains the main method and all of the user input prompts.
Assumptions are that the user knows the battlefield is oriented so the 0, 0 is at the top left and that the x axis and y axis are flipped. It is also assumed the user inputs coordinates as integer (space) integer. 
Bugs/Defects: No known bugs or errors.
